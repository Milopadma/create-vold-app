# create-vold-app

The fastest way to create a new scaffolded Nuxt 3 app template with Vold CMS integration.

```npx create-vold-app```

what can it do now? 
- scaffold a nuxt 3 app with sensible defaults (based on elementis).
- create types from /page and /homepage response from Vold CMS. 

roadmap
- [ ] sync types from response on existing create-vold-app projects.
- [ ] auto generate sections<>.vue based on /page and /homepage response.
